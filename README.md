Beckylin can solve set at http://setgame.azurewebsites.net/ in 1 minute and 44 seconds. Can you beat her? 

I certainly couldn't, so if you want the computer to do it for you, follow the steps below:
1. Make sure you have python 3 installed and on your path (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Make sure you have Edge installed (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)
2. Run the command below, which will clone this repo into the directory its run from, setup your environment, and beat Beckylin!
